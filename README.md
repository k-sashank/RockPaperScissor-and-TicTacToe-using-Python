# RockPaperScissor-and-TicTacToe-using-Python
These are two Python files, one of which emulates the Rock Paper Scissor game and the other with the TicTacToe game.
The Rock Paper Scissor game can be played by one player against the computer (created using the randint() funtion) and the TicTacToe game can be played by two players.
